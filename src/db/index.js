ðŸŒŸ Day 12/180 | Back-End Development Journey
Todayâ€™s Focus: Full-Stack Project Build (Twitter/X + YouTube Clone)
âœ… 2-hour live stream: Architected multi-page APIs with Express/MongoDB (watch here).
âœ… 6 hours of intense coding:
â€¢ Built 20+ pages/endpoints (user auth, post creation, video upload simulations).
â€¢ Integrated MongoDB for scalable data storage (schemas, relationships, middleware).
â€¢ Deployed progress to GitHub: https://github.com/M0rs-Ruki/Backend-project

Key Takeaways:
ðŸ”¹ Complex projects reveal gaps â†’ faster growth.
ðŸ”¹ Express routing + MongoDB = back-end synergy.
ðŸ”¹ Version control (GitHub) is non-negotiable for collaboration.

Next: Adding authentication and testing! Feedback/collabs welcome. ðŸš€
